Resume Notes:
-Use English-sounding names to get more callbacks/interviews. This happened because of a well-documented/researched phenomenon called name discrimination/bias. 

-Avoid using color/low-contrast color as much as possible to increase readability/avoid hiring bias. Though a color or two is probably fine.

-According to this study, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2026, adding middle initial to name makes you seem more intelligent.

-Name file FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf (or FirstName_MiddleInitial_LastName_Resume.pdf) to make it easier for employers to distinguish your resume. Underscore instead of space helps prevent incompatibility processing the file.
