Resume Tips:
-Use English-sounding names to get more callbacks/interviews. This happened because of a well-documented/researched phenomenon called name discrimination/bias. 

-Avoid using color/low-contrast color as much as possible to increase readability/avoid bias. Though a color or two is probably fine.

-According to this study, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2026. Adding middle initial to name makes you seem more intelligent. 

-Name file FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf (or FirstName_MiddleInitial_LastName_Resume.pdf) to make it easier for employers to distinguish your resume. 

-Underscore in FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf instead of space helps prevent incompatibility processing the file.
